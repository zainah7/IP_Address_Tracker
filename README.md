#  IP address tracker

This app tracks the location of an IP address and renders details related to that domain like it's location, timezone, ISP. This app is built using [Leaflet.js](https://leafletjs.com/) to render the map and all the data is fetched from [IP API](https://geo.ipify.org/).

## Overview

### The project 

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See their own IP address on the map on the initial page load
- Search for any IP addresses or domains and see the key information and location
